Key integration points:

expandDataset function in datasetController.js

Automatic dataset expansion when the number of destinations falls below a threshold

Deployment

GlobeTrotter can be deployed using Render for the backend and Netlify for the frontend.

Backend Deployment (Render)

Push Code to GitHubEnsure your backend repository is hosted on GitHub.

Create a Render Web Service

Go to Render and log in.

Click on New Web Service and connect your GitHub repository.

Select Node.js as the environment.

Set Environment VariablesIn the Render Dashboard, add the following environment variables:

MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PORT=5000

Build & Start Command

Build Command: npm install

Start Command: npm start

DeployClick on Deploy and wait for the build to complete. Your backend API will be live on https://your-app.onrender.com.

Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

Push Code to GitHubEnsure your frontend code is hosted on GitHub.

Deploy to Netlify

Go to Netlify and log in.

Click New Site from Git and select your frontend repository.
